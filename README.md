# TreasureHunt
For this project, I worked on implementing a deep Q-learning agent in Python to navigate a maze and find a treasure. I was provided with some foundational code, including the environment setup (TreasureEnvironment.py), experience replay (GameExperience.py), and the neural network model structure. My main task was to complete the Q-training algorithm and ensure the agent could successfully learn an optimal path through trial and error. I also adjusted hyperparameters and tested the model thoroughly.

This course helped me understand what computer scientists doâ€”breaking down complex problems and solving them through logic, experimentation, and structured code. Reinforcement learning showed me how an agent can learn from its environment using feedback, much like how we learn from consequences in the real world.

When approaching problems now, I think more algorithmically. I break things down into states, actions, and outcomes, and consider the consequences of each step. I also learned to iterate and refine my solutions, just like in real-world software development.

Ethically, this course reminded me of the importance of transparency, user safety, and fairness in AI. As a developer, I need to ensure that my models don't reinforce harmful biases and that I communicate how the technology works to the people affected by it.
